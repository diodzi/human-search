# HumanSearch

## Why?

More and more nowadays, when we have questions, our searchbars tend to look like:

"[actual question] reddit"

Unforunately, this feels like the easiest way to get answers from actual human beings.

## This sucks!

Agreed, but there's not much we can do about it. Here's a way to save a couple milliseconds though.

## Installation

1. Copy this: https://humansearch.diodzi.dev?search=%s
2. Follow the instructions for your browser:

- [Arc](https://arc.net/e/A9F271E9-7692-48F8-BACF-D4DDDB8AC624)
- [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95426?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)
- [Safari](https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1cztie3/comment/ljzle44/)

## Usage

Just add a question mark to the end of your search instead of adding "reddit" :)
